# Mask-On
Mask-On is real time face-mask detection which can detect human faces with and without face-mask through webcams and images.

# Motivation
The main motivation of this project came from the current situation. As we all know, 
amidst COVID19 we cannot step outside, and even if we have to, we have to use 
masks. It is observed that a lot of people neglect wearing masks. This can be dangerous 
for them as well as the people around them. Also to get entry inside any residential or 
commercial complex we need to wear a mask. Also, there are security guards appointed 
to look after it, but it also means that those security guards are risking their to check 
whether other people are wearing masks. By the use of this software along with the aid 
of a camera, we can install the system at entrances instead of a security guard. This will 
do the work for us and also keep these security guards safe.
